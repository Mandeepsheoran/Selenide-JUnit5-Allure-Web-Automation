# Selenide-JUnit5-Allure-Web-Automation
Web automation framework using Selenide (Wrapper library over Selenium), JUnit5, Allure report, Lombok, PODAM.

Selenide is an open-source Java library, built on top of Selenium Webdriver. Some of its key features included in this framework are:
- Concise API
- Automatic waits
- Automatic Screenshot
- Text Report
- Simple and easy locators

Another important library used in this framework is, PODAM which is Pojo Data Maker. This will make creating POJO test data very easy where random data can be created to pass the test data in test cases.

Allure report is also integrated which has in-built support in Selenide. We can directly generate Allure report using text/junit reports generated with Selenide without doing any Allure related setup.
